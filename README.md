# flight-delay-time-series-analysis
Performed **time series analysis** on U.S. flight delay data to identify trends, seasonality, and stationarity using ADF, ACF, and PACF tests, followed by developing an **LSTM-based forecasting model** in Python (TensorFlow, Pandas, Statsmodels) to accurately predict daily flight delays and improve predictive insights.
